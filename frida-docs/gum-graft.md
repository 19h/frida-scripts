The `gum-graft` tool is used for patching binaries ahead of time to allow
Interceptor to instrument them in environments where runtime code modifications
are prohibited. For now this only means Apple mobile OSes when strict
code-signing policies are at play -- i.e. on jailed systems when running an app
without a debugger having been attached. In such cases, override the [Gadget][]
`code_signing` option and set it to `required`.

You can download `gum-graft` from the [releases page][].
